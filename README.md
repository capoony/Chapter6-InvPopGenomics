### Introduction 

Chromosomal inversions are structural mutations the result in the reorientation of the gene order in the affected genomic region@kapunAdaptiveSignificanceChromosomal2019; @berdanHowChromosomalInversions2023. The reversal of synteny impedes homologous pairing in heterokaryotypic chromosomes in the nucleus and leads to loop structures at the chromosomal region spanned by the inversion @torgashevaSynapsisRecombinationInversion2010. These characteristic inversion loops (Figure 1) can be examined under the microscope in polytene chromosomes, which are giant thousand-fold replicated chromatids within a nucleus @cooperConcerningOriginPolytene1938that can be found, for example, in the salivary glands many Drosophilid fruit fly larvae e.g.,  @bridgesSalivaryAnalysisInversion3rPayne1938; @dobzhanskyInversionsChromosomesDrosophila. For these resasons, inversions were the among first mutations ever to be directly studied more than 100 years ago. The primary evolutionary effect of inversions is a strong suppression of recombination (but not gene conversion) with standard arrangement chromosomes since crossing-over within the inversion results in unbalanced gametes that are non-viable. As a result, both the ancestral standard and the derived inverted karyotype evolve largely independent, leading to increased divergence over time. Since most inversions result from unique mutation events, the newly formed inversion evolves from a single haplotype of the ancestral standard arrangement and diverges over time by accumultaing novel mutations.  <MORE HERE>
