#### Introduction 

Chromosomal inversions are structural mutations the result in the reorientation of the gene order in the affected genomic regions@kapunAdaptiveSignificanceChromosomal2019; @berdanHowChromosomalInversions2023. The reversal of synteny impedes homologous pairing in heterokaryotypic chromosomes and leads to loop structures at the inverted regions. These loops are visible under the microscope in chromosomes during metaphase or in polytene chromosomes, which can be found, for example, in the salivary glands of third instar larvae of many Drosophilid fruit flies. For these resasons, inversions were the first muttations to be studied and described by Thomas Hunt Morgen and his students more than 100 years ago.
