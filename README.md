#### Introduction 

Chromosomal inversions are structural mutations the result in the reorientation of the gene order in the affected genomic region@kapunAdaptiveSignificanceChromosomal2019; @berdanHowChromosomalInversions2023. The reversal of synteny impedes homologous pairing in heterokaryotypic chromosomes in the nucleus and leads to loop structures at the chromosomal region spanned by the inversion. These characteristic inversion loops can be visible under the microscope in chromosomes during metaphase or in polytene chromosomes, which can be found, for example, in the salivary glands many Drosophilid fruit fly larvae (Figure 1). For these resasons, inversions were the first chromosomal mutations ever to be studied and described by Thomas Hunt Morgen and his students more than 100 years ago. The primary evolutionary effect of inversions is the strong suppression of recombination with standard arrangement chromossomes since crossing-over within the inversion results in unbalanced gametes that are non-viable. <MORE HERE>
